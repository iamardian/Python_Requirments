### What is the difference between int, float, str, bool, complex, bytes, and bytearray data types?

* **int** is the data type for integers. Integers can be positive, negative, or zero.

    ```python
    x = 12345
    y = -67890
    z = 0
    ```

* **float** is the data type for floating-point numbers. Floating-point numbers can be positive, negative, or zero, and they can have decimals.

    ```python
    x = 1.2345
    y = -6.7890
    z = 0.0
    ```

* **str** is the data type for strings. Strings are sequences of characters.

    ```python
    x = "Hello, world!"
    y = "This is a string."
    z = ""
    ```

* **bool** is the data type for Boolean values. Boolean values can be either `True` or `False`.

    ```python
    x = True
    y = False
    ```

* **complex** is the data type for complex numbers. Complex numbers are numbers of the form `a + bi`, where `a` is the real part and `b` is the imaginary part.

    ```python
    x = 1 + 2j
    y = -3 - 4j
    z = 0j
    ```

* **bytes** is the data type for bytes. Bytes are sequences of eight-bit integers.

    ```python
    x = b"Hello, world!"
    y = b"This is a binary string."
    z = b""
    ```

* **bytearray** is the data type for bytearrays. Bytearrays are mutable sequences of eight-bit integers.

    ```python
    x = bytearray("Hello, world!", "utf-8")
    y = bytearray("This is a binary string.", "utf-8")
    z = bytearray()
    ```

Here is a table that summarizes the differences between the int, float, str, bool, complex, bytes, and bytearray data types:

| Data type | Description |
|---|---|
| **int** | Integers |
| **float** | Floating-point numbers |
| **str** | Strings |
| **bool** | Boolean values |
| **complex** | Complex numbers |
| **bytes** | Bytes |
| **bytearray** | Mutable bytes |

I hope this explanation is clear and comprehensive. Let me know if you have any other questions.
